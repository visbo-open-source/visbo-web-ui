All VISBO software is provided strictly on an "as-is" basis.
No warranties, guarantees, or assurances of any Kind whether express, implied, statutory, or otherwise are provided.
This includes, but is not limited to, warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, or continuous availability of the software or repositories.

VISBO Contributor License Agreement (CLA):

**See: `CLA.md`**

The current CLA ensures that:

- You retain authorship of your Contribution.
- You grant VISBO GmbH **and any future acquiring entity** a perpetual, irrevocable,
  worldwide, royalty-free right to **use, modify, distribute, sublicense, and commercialize**
  your Contribution.
- VISBO and/or an acquiring entity may use your Contribution in
  proprietary, closed-source, SaaS, OEM, or otherwise commercial products.

# 4. How to Contribute Code
## 4.1 Fork the Repository
1. Click **Fork** at the top-right of the GitHub repository page.  
2. Clone your fork:
Bash: 
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo>.git
4.2 Create a Feature Branch
Please follow this branch naming convention:
git checkout -b feature/<short-description>
Examples:
* feature/add-api-endpoint
* feature/ui-dark-mode
* bugfix/login-timeout


4.3 Coding Guidelines
Please ensure:
* Code is clean, readable, and well-structured
* Public functions and APIs are documented
* for visbo server and web-ui only: ESLint / Prettier / TypeScript or Java conventions are respected (per repo)
* Tests are included if applicable
* Commit messages describe why the change was made, not only what


# 4.4 Linting (Required before Pull Requests) (applies only for visbo Server and web-ui) 

VISBO uses **ESLint** to ensure consistent code quality and to detect potential errors early.

Before submitting a Pull Request, contributors are **strongly encouraged** to run ESLint
on the files they have changed.

## Configuration
The repository contains:
- **.eslintrc.cjs** â Safe ESLint configuration for Node.js / Express (CommonJS)
- **.eslintignore** â Defines files and folders excluded from linting

## Lint Commands

Lint the complete project (no auto-fix):
```
npm run lint -- .
```

Lint a specific folder:
```
npm run lint -- components/
npm run lint -- routes/
```

Lint a single file:
```
npm run lint -- components/timeTracker.js
```

Apply automatic fixes (recommended only for specific files or folders):
```
npm run lint:fix -- components/timeTracker.js
```

## Best Practices
- Always commit your work before running `lint:fix`
- Review all changes using `git diff`
- Apply fixes incrementally (file by file)
- Avoid large formatting-only pull requests

Pull Requests that introduce new ESLint errors may be requested to be updated
before review or merge.


4. Submitting a Pull Request
4.1 Push Your Branch
git push origin feature/<short-description>
4.2 Open a Pull Request (PR)
In the PR, please include:
* A clear description of the change
* The problem it solves
* Screenshots (if UI-related)
* Notes on testing or potential impact
A VISBO or other maintainer will review the PR, discuss improvements if needed, and merge it once ready.

5. Reporting Bugs

* Steps to reproduce
* Expected behaviour
* Actual behaviour
* Logs or screenshots (if applicable)

Use the Bug Report issue template when available.
