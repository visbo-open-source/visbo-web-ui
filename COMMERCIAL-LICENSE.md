# VISBO Commercial License Summary  
Version 1.0 — Effective from 20.11.2025

This document provides a **summary** of the commercial licensing terms for the VISBO Software.  
It complements the open-source license (AGPL v3 with Commons Clause) under which VISBO is made available in this repository.

For legally binding terms, a separate written license agreement must be executed between VISBO GmbH and the licensee.

---

## 1. Background

The VISBO Software is made available as **source-available software** under:

- **AGPL v3** (GNU Affero General Public License, Version 3), and  
- the **Commons Clause** restriction,  

which limits certain forms of commercial exploitation (in particular, “Selling” the Software as a service).

For organisations that require extended commercial rights not permitted under AGPL v3 + Commons Clause, VISBO GmbH offers a **commercial license** (dual licensing model).

---

## 2. Scope of the Commercial License (Summary)

Under a commercial license, the licensee may obtain rights that include, for example:

- Operating VISBO as a **multi-tenant SaaS platform** for multiple customers.  
- Hosting VISBO for **multiple unaffiliated organisations** as a managed service.  
- Integrating VISBO into **proprietary or closed-source products**.  
- Distributing VISBO-based solutions **without being bound by AGPL copyleft requirements**.  
- Commercially sublicensing VISBO-based products or services to third parties.

The exact scope of rights is defined in the individual written license agreement.

---

## 3. Relationship to the Open-Source License

The commercial license:

- **supplements** the AGPL v3 + Commons Clause license,  
- does **not** revoke or invalidate the open-source license for existing users, and  
- applies **only** to licensees that have entered into a written commercial license agreement with VISBO.

Existing AGPL v3 + Commons Clause users may continue to use VISBO under those terms, or may choose to upgrade to a commercial license if their use case requires it.

---

## 4. Fees (Indicative Structure)

A typical commercial license model may include:

- a **one-time license fee**, and  
- an ongoing **revenue-based fee** (for example, a percentage of ARR — annual recurring revenue — generated from VISBO-based services).

The actual fee structure and amounts are subject to negotiation and are specified in the individual contract.

---

## 5. Trademarks and Branding

The VISBO name and logo are protected identifiers of VISBO GmbH.

Use of VISBO trademarks, logos, or other branding elements in marketing materials, product names, or user interfaces requires **prior written consent** from VISBO GmbH, unless explicitly permitted in the commercial license agreement.

---

## 6. No Warranty (Summary)

Unless otherwise agreed in a separate written support or SLA agreement, VISBO Software is provided:

> “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,  
> whether express or implied, including but not limited to the implied warranties of  
> MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, and NON-INFRINGEMENT.

Any additional warranties, support commitments or SLAs must be expressly agreed in writing.
